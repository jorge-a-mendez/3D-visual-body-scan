- Ask Prof how to detect person. Have tried edge detection, contour extraction, background subtraction. Nothing works.
	+ Check the last thing we did.
- Calibration.
	+ Maybe use calibration pattern?
	+ Check with the Prof. the method he suggested about three images of the body.
- Geometric reconstruction (hull).
	+ How to extract relative rotations of the cameras from the object (box).
		. Maybe not needed. Intelligent algorithms implemented by OpenCV with corner points from different images.
	+ 2D hull of every layer made from tangent lines of every image.
	+ Tangent lines are camera rays.
